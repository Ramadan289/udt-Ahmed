        Leonardo’s parents were unmarried at the time of his birth.
         His father, Ser Piero, was a Florentine notary and landlord,
        and his mother, Caterina, was a young peasant woman who shortly
        thereafter married an artisan. Leonardo grew up on his father’s
        family’s estate, where he was treated as a “legitimate” son and
        received the usual elementary education of that day: reading,
        writing, and arithmetic. Leonardo did not seriously study Latin,
        the key language of traditional learning, until much later, when
        he acquired a working knowledge of it on his own. He also did
        not apply himself to higher mathematics—advanced geometry and 
        arithmetic—until he was 30 years old, when he began to study 
        it with diligent tenacity.
        Leonardo’s artistic inclinations must have appeared early.
         When he was about 15, his father, who enjoyed a high reputation 
         in the Florence community, apprenticed him to artist Andrea del
        Verrocchio. In Verrocchio’s renowned workshop Leonardo received
        a multifaceted training that included painting and sculpture as 
        well as the technical-mechanical arts. He also worked in the 
        next-door workshop of artist Antonio Pollaiuolo. In 1472 Leonardo
        was accepted into the painters’ guild of Florence, but he remained
        in his teacher’s workshop for five more years, after which time he
        worked independently in Florence until 1481. There are a great
        many superb extant pen and pencil drawings from this period, 
        including many technical sketches—for example, pumps, military 
        weapons, mechanical apparatus—that offer evidence of Leonardo’s
        interest in and knowledge of technical matters even at the outset
        of his career.
